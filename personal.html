        <h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
        <p>&ensp;Professional values can guide someone into what career is the best for them. In nursing,
          some values that I already highly value is the act of being empathetic and sympathetic towards
          everyone, being gentle and kind, yet firm and confident. Nurses are some of the most resilient
          workers. They are there to serve, listen, advocate, promote health, safety, and trust. These are the
          core values that are guiding my work because these characteristics are who I want to be defined
          as. As a nurse, I know I will be resilient and a hard worker. I will be humble, kind, helpful,
          patient, respectful, responsible, open minded, empathetic, sympathetic, and compassionate, not
          only with patients but with staff too. I will advocate for anyone and listen to those that need to be
          heard. I understand that my ethical responsibility as a professional nurse is to promote safety and
          health, maintain competence, confidentiality, privacy, and integrity, respect patient’s rights and
          choices, and advocate for what’s ethically right in patient care.
          As I progress through my nursing career, I will promote exemplary nursing practices by
          maintaining and following my core values to be the person I aspire to be as a nurse. I will
          provide personalized care for every patient’s specific needs. I will provide active listening and
          my full attention to each patient under my care. I will use my core values to create patient-nurse
          relationships to create connections and trust. I will be efficient with my time and resources to
          ensure I am provided quality and safe patient centered care. Lastly, I will make sure I am taking
          the time to provide self-care for myself. Self-care is an important aspect of nursing just as much
          
          as taking care of patients is. As nurses, we need to take the time to care for ourselves so we can
          be better nurses for our patients and provide top notch care. When we take care of ourselves, we
          are filled with more happiness and energy that we can use to fuel our successful practices.
          My commitment as a nurse is to my patients, my community, and my profession. This is
          why it is important to me to follow my core values and implement them in my practice because
          these characteristics are what successful nurses look like in my eyes. Patient’s also benefit from
          nurses who implement these core values because we are ensuring that we are providing quality
          and safe patient centered care that allows the patient to feel heard, seen, and taken care of. In my
          community, and in future communities that I will be a part of, my commitment is to ensure that
          the quality patient centered care rolls out into the community so that the patients that fall in my
          hands will have positive outcomes after discharge. It is also my duty to help guide my patients to
          resources that will help them find their ways in their community such as housing, food, water,
          clothing, healthcare, etc. Although we cannot provide explicit information, we can guide our
          patients to those who are certified in providing these resources for them, such as social workers.
          It is a team effort in the hospital and in the community to ensure our patients are always taken
          care of inside and outside of the hospital. As for my profession, my commitment is to make sure
          I am being the nurse that I would desire to have if I was a patient. I will also make sure I am
          following the Nurse Practice Act and the Nursing Code of Ethics in my practice so that I am
          always showing professionalism and acting in a manner that is appropriate for my scope of
          practice and role as a nurse. I will also make sure to always be a team player in my nursing
          environments. It is important to be able to work with other people so that we can all help one
          another be successful professionally and individually. Overall, my commitments to my patients,
          my community, and my profession will always be my top priority in my nursing career.
          
          In the working class world, it is important to have professional short term and long term
          goals so that there is a plan and purpose for striving for success. As of now, my short term
          professional goals are to focus on completing my nursing program, graduating, and getting my
          first nursing job as a new grad. My long term professional goals are to grasp all the bedside care
          skills I can gather as a registered nurse, use my core values to be a successful, patient centered
          nurse, complete the psychiatric Nurse Practitioner post licensure program, graduate with my
          master’s degree, get a secondary certification in family Nurse Practitioner, and become a
          successful Nurse Practitioner. These professional goals are definitely attainable, so I know that I
          will be able to accomplish every goal that I have listed and will continue to create and
          accomplish goals as I progress through my nursing career.</p>
